      <description>A concise step-by-step guide to setup a Rstudio Server in Ubuntu Linux. The assumption is made that the server is already setup. There are instructions on how to setup a server in Amazon AWS in the first section of this article.
One of the main objectives of this short how-to is to keep a quick list of Linux dependencies based on the R packages that we plan to install.

      <description>The following method sets up a single user in the RStudio server that also has ‘write’ access in the Shiny server. Using Samba, we will create a shared folder inside the RStudio server user that maps directly to the shiny-server folder inside the Shiny server. The assumption is made that the ‘client’ RStudio server is running an Ubuntu (Debian) distribution.
The plan is to:
Create a user in the Shiny and RStudio server with the same name and passwordInstall and configure the Samba server in the Shiny serverInstall and configure the Samba client in the RStudio serverPoint the shiny-server folder to a local folder in the RStudio server’s userIn the Shiny serverOpen a new terminal session in the Shiny ServerWe’ll create the new user, give it ‘admin’ access and then we remove the need for it to use the ‘sudo’ command</description>
