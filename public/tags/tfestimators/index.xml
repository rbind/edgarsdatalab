      <description>TensorFlow is usually associated with neural networks and advanced Machine Learning. But just like R, it can also be used to create less complex models that can serve as a great introduction for new users, like me.
Training wheelsTensorFlow is a very powerful and flexible architecture. It provides the building blocks to create and fit basically any machine learning algorithm. But even a simple linear regression model has to be built “from scratch” using layers and estimators in TensorFlow.</description>
