      <description>TensorFlow is usually associated with neural networks and advanced Machine Learning. But just like R, it can also be used to create less complex models that can serve as a great introduction for new users, like me.
Training wheelsTensorFlow is a very powerful and flexible architecture. It provides the building blocks to create and fit basically any machine learning algorithm. But even a simple linear regression model has to be built “from scratch” using layers and estimators in TensorFlow.</description>

      <description>Quick introGetting familiar with the new tidytext package was a great weekend project. This example follows the structure of the Introduction to tidytext article by the authors of the package, Julia Silge and David Robinson.
The source of the text for this example are tweets. More specifically, tweets with the rstats hashtag. This project will also be an attempt to learn something about the community.
Twitter data importThe twitterR package opens the Twitter API to R users.</description>
