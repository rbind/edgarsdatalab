The following method sets up a single user in the RStudio server that also has ‘write’ access in the Shiny server.   Using [Samba](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/samba.html), we will create a shared folder inside the RStudio server user that maps directly to the *shiny-server* folder inside the Shiny server. The assumption is made that the ‘client’ RStudio server is running an Ubuntu (Debian) distribution.

The plan is to:

1. Create a user in the Shiny and RStudio server with the same name and password
1. Install and configure the Samba *server* in the Shiny server
1. Install and configure the Samba *client* in the RStudio server
1. Point the *shiny-server* folder to a local folder in the RStudio server’s user

## In the Shiny server

- Open a new terminal session in the Shiny Server
- We’ll create the new user, give it ‘admin’ access and then we remove the need for it to use the ‘sudo’ command
```bash
sudo adduser shiny-user
sudo usermod -aG sudo shiny-user
sudo chown shiny-user /srv/shiny-server/
sudo chgrp sudo /srv/shiny-server/
```
- Install Samba
```bash
sudo apt-get install samba
sudo smbpasswd -a shiny-user [typed password twice]
```
- Open the *smb.conf* file for editing
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
- Add the following lines at the end of the *smb.conf* file:
```bash
[shiny-server]
comment = Shiny Server Share
path=/srv/shiny-server/
browsable = yes
valid users = shiny-user
read only = no
```
- Close the file by typing CRTL+X, then Y and enter
- Restart the Samba server
```bash
sudo service smbd restart
```
## In the RStudio server

- Start a terminal session in the ‘client’ RStudio Server
- Create the new user
```bash
sudo adduser shiny-user
```
- In a web browser session, navigate to the RStudio server and log on as ‘shiny-user’
- Create a folder called *shiny-server*
- Switch back to the terminal session in the RStudio server
- Install the Samba client
```bash
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```
- Open the *fstab* file for editing. This file contains the necessary information to automate the process of mounting shares 
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
- Add the following lines at the end of the file
```bash
//[ Shiny server's Internal IP Address]/shiny-server  /home/shiny-user/shiny-server  cifs  username=shiny-user,password=shiny-user
```
- Close the file by typing CRTL+X, then Y and enter
- ‘Mount’ the share, which means that the internal folder now points to the folder in the external Shiny server
```bash
sudo mount -a
```
- Go back to the web browser that has the RStudio session
- Click on the *shiny-server* folder.  If there were any previously published apps in the Shiny server, then they should show up in the this folder now.
- To confirm that the permissions are correct, create a new Shiny app, called server_test inside the **shiny-server** folder
- Navigate to your new app by going to: http://MY_PUBLIC_DNS:3838/server_test
